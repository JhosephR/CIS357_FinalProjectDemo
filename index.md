# Notifications / Firebase Cloud Messaging – Android

## Overview

This tutorial is a simple application that uses the user interface of Notifications from Android, and Cloud Messaging services from Firebase in Kotlin. Firebase – Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a solution for sending messages across devices, and notification across platforms for free. In this project, we will show how to create a notification and send a message using this service.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JhosephR/CIS357_FinalProjectDemo/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
